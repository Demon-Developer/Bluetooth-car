🚗 Bluetooth Car

This is a fun DIY project where a small car is controlled using Bluetooth via a mobile phone. It's a great way to learn about electronics, embedded programming, and wireless communication.

📱 Features

- Control car movement using a mobile phone (forward, backward, left, right, stop)
- Bluetooth-based wireless communication
- Easy to build and customize

🔧 Components Used

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno/Nano)
- Bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06)
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
- DC motors with wheels
- Chassis
- Battery pack
- Jumper wires
- Android phone with a Bluetooth controller app (e.g., Bluetooth RC Controller)

📲 How It Works

1. Pair your mobile phone with the Bluetooth module.
2. Use a Bluetooth control app to send commands to the car.
3. The microcontroller interprets these commands and drives the motors accordingly.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Connect the components as shown in your circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
3. Power the car using a suitable battery.
4. Open the Bluetooth app on your phone, connect to the HC-05/06 module.
5. Use directional buttons in the app to drive the car.

📂 Project Files

- `car_code.ino` - Arduino sketch that controls the car
- Circuit diagram
- Optional: 3D print files or chassis design (if any)

📷 Screenshots / Demo

> Add images or a GIF/video link of the car in action

✅ To Do / Ideas

- Add obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensor
- Add speed control (PWM)
- Make it voice-controlled
- Add light or horn control
